# Blockchain
This is a blockchain developed in Rust heavily inspired in Bitcoin. The aim is
to succesfully implement a simple distributed transaction system in Rust. It
should be usefull for understanding a bit of how bitcoin works and for
educational purposes.

## Why Rust

Rust is used in systems programming, and I wanted to use its speed and safety
when implementing the blockchain.

## Post Quantum Cryptography

I have been working with post quantum cryptography, so I wanted to support it.
This implementation uses openssl and liboqs.

## How to run

Clone the repository and run the following command:
```bash
cargo run
```

## Examples
